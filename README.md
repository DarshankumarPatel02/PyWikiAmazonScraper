## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that scrapes data from the Wikipedia page listing the [Largest Companies in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_Canada). The script makes use of **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping and **Pandas** for data manipulation and exporting to CSV.

### Key Features:
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts data from a table on Wikipedia.
- **Data Processing**: Structures the scraped data into a **Pandas DataFrame**.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the data to `Canada_Companies.csv` for further analysis.

This project demonstrates how to:
- Automate data collection from a live website.
- Process HTML table data into a tabular format.
- Export the cleaned and structured data for future use.
