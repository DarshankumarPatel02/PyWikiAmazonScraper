This repository contains a Python script for scraping data from the Wikipedia page listing the Largest Companies in Canada. The script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML and extract table data, and Pandas to manipulate the data and export it into a CSV file.

Key Features:
Web Scraping: Automatically extracts data from a Wikipedia table.
Data Processing: Organizes the data into a structured Pandas DataFrame.
CSV Export: Saves the extracted data as Canada_Companies.csv for further analysis.
This project serves as an example of how to automate the process of gathering real-time data from a webpage and converting it into a usable format, which is essential for tasks like data analysis and reporting.
